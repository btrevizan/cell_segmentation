# Cell Image Segmentation
This is a Computational Photography's final project from Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). 

The goal is to segment and classify cells by type (red, gray and yellow). 
The segmentation lacks in finding yellow cells. 
Feel free to fork this project and continue my work.

For more information about how and what was done, read the report available in `docs/`.
